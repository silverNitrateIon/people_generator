# people_generator

This is a very early stage prototype for a synthetic data generator I developed which makes use of a hieherarical system to produce linked datum. More complete system to come once I find whatever HDD I have it stored on.

### Known issues:

- Runtime: It won't run.
- Statistical: The distributions are made up.
- Code Quality: What's that?
